Project RockBottom
------------------

Our project is called Web App Classic Arcade, and our goal is to make a web application arcade
that contains many single player classic games. Some of the games are including hangman,
tic-tac-toe, solitaire, etc. Though they will be the classic games that everyone knows and loves
some will contain special features to make them new and interesting. For example, when the player
has guessed the correct word for hangman not only will the word be revealed but so will the
definition. This allows players to not only play a game, but it also gives them an opportunity to
expand their vocabulary.

The app is for any age that enjoys playing old classic games. Users might prefer our app
over other competitors because not only are we going to be adding special features to some of the
games, but also all these games will be in one easy to use app. We want to design the app in a
way that is both appealing to young technically skilled users and easy to use for other less
technically skilled users.

The main language we will be developing the web app in is dart with flutter framework.
