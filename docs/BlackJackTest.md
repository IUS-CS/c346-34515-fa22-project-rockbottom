Testing one

1. I went through and tested many many possibilities and made sure the busting dialog worked especially
    for the dealer opposed to just the player.

Testing two

1. I went through and tested winning multiple times to make sure that total was working properly even
    for the dealer.

Testing three

1. I made sure to test that the losing worked especially for busting yet again and this also goes for
    the dealer too

Testing four

1. I had to make sure that the Ace was accurately being used as 1 or 11 respectively and that caused
    a lot of problems and are fixed
